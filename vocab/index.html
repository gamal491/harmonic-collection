<p> <a>Crescent:</a> a curved arc shape
<br>
    <a>Gibbous:</a> convex; having the  illuminated part greater than a semicircle
<br>
    <a>Lunar eclipse:</a> when Earth is between the Sun and the Moon, causing Earth to cast a shadow on the Moon; and the Moon is illuminated
<br>
    <a>Lunar month:</a> the time between the recurrences of the same phase: Because of the eccentricity of the Moon's orbit, this duration is not perfectly constant but it averages about 29.5 days
<br>
    <a>Lunar phase:</a> (Also called a <strong>Moon phase</strong>) the shape of the moonâ€™s directly sunlit portion as it appears from the Earth
<br>
    <a>Quarter:</a> <strong>Half!</strong> Contrary to our set knowledge that a quarter is visibly 25%, this looks like half a pie
<br>
    <a>Solar eclipse:</a> when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, causing a silhouette of the Moon to be visible on Earth with a ring of the sun behind it
<br>
    <a>Waning:</a> to decrease; progressively becoming smaller (right side is darkened)
<br>
    <a>Waxing:</a> to increase; becoming larger in size (right side is illuminated)
