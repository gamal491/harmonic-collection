<p><i>Supplemento al dizionario italiano (Supplement to the Italian dictionary)</i> written by Bruno Munari is a book about the hand gestures 
    tied to the Italian language and what they mean. It was published in 1963 by Corraini Editore and is a paperback. The paper quality 
    is a dense, off-white, yellow cardstock paper. It provides all text in 4 languages: Italian, English, French, and German. Munari chose 
    to use a lot of imagery in the book, limiting it to one black and white image per gesture. Each image is on the right page, with text 
    explaining the italian hand gesture on the left page. <br>

<br>Munari keeps everything in a grid; small cap typography in all 4 languages at the top with the title of the gesture, ex: “Un Momento!” 
    (“Just a minute!”), and longer text with a description of the gesture and how to emphasize it, again in all 4 languages, evenly spaced out. <br>

<br>Munari uses the Gestalt theory in the cover of the book, making the italian writing larger than the other 3 translations to give it greater hierarchy. 
He keeps English, French, and German in the same text size to give them equal importance. He uses proximity with the 4 titles to unify them and give 
them the same meaning. He uses small caps for his name and bold style text to give it emphasis and differentiate the author from the title of the book. <br>

<br>My overall impression of the book is positive. I really liked Munari’s simplicity in the book design and use of a grid. I appreciate the similarity in 
each book spread that makes the book design unified. </p>
