        <i>(Also referred to as a "half-moon".)</i></p>
        <br> 
            <p>One of the primary phases in the lunar cycle, 
            occurring about 7 days after the New Moon phase.
            Exactly half of the Moon's visible side is illuminated by the Sun.
            <br> This lunar phase is symbolic of growth, progession, and renewal.
            It is known to be a time for meditation, ritual, setting intentions, 
            or as a reminder to start taking steps toward one's goals and dreams. </p>

    <!--<h2>A bit of history...</h2>
    <p> The moon is illuminated by light from the sun. As the moon moves around Earth, 
        the amount of illumination it receives from the sun changes, creating the lunar phases.
        The complete cycle of phases, lasts approximately 29.5 days, known as a lunar month. </p>-->
    
    <p> There are eight primary phases of the Moon:

     <h2>Focus:</h2>
        Throughout the month of September, I documented each moon phase I saw in each retrospective week of the month. 
        My goal is to do research regarding the significance, historical context, and spiritual connotations 
        associated with each lunar phase. My fascination with the moon has motivated me to seek a deeper understanding. 
        If you share this curiosity and often find yourself capturing the moon through photographs but wish to 
        expand your knowledge, I invite you to join me on this 10-week exploration!
